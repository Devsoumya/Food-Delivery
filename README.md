# Foodie(food delivery)

A simple raw PHP & Javascript based website that is similar to foodpanda. Users can order food online from restaurants from different locations. And the admin can check out all the proccesses like users, deliveries, total sales etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Xampp installed on your pc or a online php hosting.

### Installing

Download Xampp from this link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and install it.

## Deployment

Deployment to a PC:
⦁	Copy all the files to a folder called “Foodie”.
⦁	Copy the folder “Foodie” to a folder inside the directory where XAMPP is installed, called “htdocs”.
⦁	Open XAMPP and press the first two “Start” buttons to turn your PC into the server.
⦁	Open a web browser (i.e. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).
⦁	Type in the following address: localhost/Foodie.
⦁	Now, type in the following address: localhost/phpmyadmin
⦁	Import the .sql file from the “database” folder, which is inside the “Foodie” folder of “htdocs”.
Now, you can use our website on your PC.

Deployment online: 
⦁	Let’s assume we bought the domain “foodie.com”.
⦁	We will also need to rent a web-server and bandwidth from a hosting service.
⦁	The hosting service will give us access to the server, where we can upload files and install custom scripts to keep our site up and running.
